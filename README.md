# 👨‍💻 About me

Hello how are you? My name is Enzo, I'm 13 years old, this is **my Git Hhub profile.** Here you will see information about my profile. The idea of me wanting to be a programmer is very broad, because I love programming and I want to do that several, so I want to learn the basics until I become someone who knows how to program and do incredible things.

 Well, I'm a person who likes to create different profiles that are beautiful and flashy in git hub, or any other platform that can make a beautiful profile, so you can see that I constantly update my profile, like now lol, whether to put something or take away.
 Learning English is also essential for me, as I'm Brazilian, but that's just a matter of time.
